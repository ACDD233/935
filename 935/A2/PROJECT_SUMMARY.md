# Project Summary - Rice Disease Classification System

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based rice disease classification system for the CSCI935 Computer Vision group assignment. The system uses YOLOv8s-cls (classification model) to identify five types of rice diseases from leaf images captured in both field and white background settings.

## Project Architecture

### Design Decisions

1. **Model Choice: YOLOv8s-cls**
   - **Why Classification over Detection?**
     - Task requirement: Identify disease type (classification), not localize disease regions (detection)
     - Classification models are simpler, faster to train, and more appropriate for this use case
     - Lower computational requirements

   - **Why YOLOv8s-cls specifically?**
     - State-of-the-art performance in image classification
     - Pre-trained on ImageNet provides excellent feature extraction
     - Efficient architecture suitable for 224×224 images
     - Built-in data augmentation and training pipeline

2. **Single Unified Model**
   - One model handles all three evaluation scenarios (white background, field background, mixed)
   - Training combines both background types for robustness
   - Demonstrates model learns disease features, not background features

3. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separation of concerns: preprocessing, training, evaluation, inference
   - Each module can be used independently
   - Easy to maintain and extend
